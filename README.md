# How-To-Use-Git-And-Github
A guide on how to utilize Git &amp; Github for all your software needs!

## What is Git?
- Git is most widely used version control system that is used today. It is utilized for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

- With git, you can easily see what other people on your team are working on, view your previous changes to the code, and you can rollback to your previous code. 

- Git is also what programmers use to push code onto Github through their command prompt or terminal. Instead of uploading files onto Github manually, programmers use git to simply push their code or any other files online through a couple commands.

## What is Github?
- Github is world's hub for open-source software. It is where you can view other people's projects, publish your own projects, and get inspiration for future projects. If you are working for a company and your responsibilities involve programming, you will most likely be using Github to collaborate with other team members on a codebase.

- The main feature of Github is repositories, and within them, you can view all the source code and files for a given project. You can also "fork" repositories from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.
